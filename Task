Option 2: Re-Identification in a Single Feed

Objective:

Given a 15-second video (15sec_input_720p.mp4), identify each player and ensure that players who go out of frame and reappear are assigned the same identity as before.

Instructions:

Use the provided object detection model to detect players throughout the clip.

Assign player IDs based on the initial few seconds.

Maintain the same ID for players when they re-enter the frame later in the video (e.g., near the goal event).

Your solution should simulate real-time re-identification and player tracking.

Process followed:
The following steps were undertaken to build the Football Player Detection and Re Identification System:

 1. Frame Extraction: A 15-second football broadcast video was used as the input source. A total of 75 frames were extracted using OpenCV for annotation and training.
 2. Dataset Creation using Roboflow: Each frame was uploaded to Roboflow, where manual annotations were performed. The labeled categories included:
 • Football players
 • Referee
 • Football
 • Other objects (e.g., goalposts, etc.)
 Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, brightness/contrast adjustment, and blurring were applied. The final dataset contained:
 • 238 images total
 • 222 images for training
 • 11 images for validation
 • 5 images for testing
