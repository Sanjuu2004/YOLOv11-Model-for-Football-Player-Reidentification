Option 2: Re-Identification in a Single Feed

Objective:

Given a 15-second video (15sec_input_720p.mp4), identify each player and ensure that players who go out of frame and reappear are assigned the same identity as before.

Instructions:

Use the provided object detection model to detect players throughout the clip.

Assign player IDs based on the initial few seconds.

Maintain the same ID for players when they re-enter the frame later in the video (e.g., near the goal event).

Your solution should simulate real-time re-identification and player tracking.
